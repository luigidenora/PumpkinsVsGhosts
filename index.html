        As the moon rises and the night falls, the field becomes a battleground. From the eerie shadows on the right,
        waves of ghosts emerge, their eyes glowing with a spectral light. They drift
        closer and closer to your base, their ghostly wails echoing in the night.
      </p>
      <p class="info-description">
        But fear not! For you have a powerful ally - the mighty pumpkin. With each gold point you collect, you can plant
        a pumpkin on the field. Each pumpkin stands as a brave sentinel, glowing
        brightly in the moonlight.
      </p>
      <p class="info-description">
        As the ghosts approach, your pumpkins spring into action. With each attack, a ghost is vanquished, dissolving
        into the night from whence it came. Your goal is to strategically place your
        pumpkins to create an impenetrable defense against these spectral invaders.
      </p>
      <p class="info-description">
        With each level, the challenge grows, but remember - each pumpkin planted is a beacon of hope in the face of
        these spooky specters. Stand firm, strategize wisely, and may your pumpkins
        always stand strong against the ghostly onslaught!
